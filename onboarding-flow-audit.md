## Issues Found:

### Progress Bar Inconsistencies:
Many screens still show old progress values (e.g., "Step X of 13" instead of "Step X of 20")

### Navigation Issues:
The flow has some unused screens (DreamOutcome) that are registered but not part of the main flow.

## Corrections Needed:
1. Update all progress bars to show correct "Step X of 20" values
2. Update progress percentages to match 20-screen flow
3. Remove unused screens from navigation flow
